To fix this issue, avoid using the `@apply` directive within components rendered server-side. Instead, create separate utility classes that include the styles defined within `@apply`. This allows for consistent style application regardless of the rendering environment.

Here's an example demonstrating how to refactor the component:

**bug.js (Problematic code):**
```javascript
// ... component code ...
<div class="@apply bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">Content</div>
// ...
```

**bugSolution.js (Corrected code):**
```javascript
// ... component code ...
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">Content</div>
// ...
```

By directly applying the utility classes, we avoid the potential inconsistencies caused by the `@apply` directive during SSR.  This approach ensures consistent styling across both server-side and client-side rendering.
