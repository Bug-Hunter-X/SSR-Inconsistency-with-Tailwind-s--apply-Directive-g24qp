This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that employs server-side rendering (SSR). The issue arises when Tailwind's `@apply` directive is used within a component's template. During SSR, the `@apply` directive might not be correctly processed, leading to missing or improperly applied styles on the client-side. This results in a visual discrepancy between the server-rendered output and the fully-rendered client-side version.
